## Island Troll Tribes Source ##

This is the map source to the Warcraft III custom map Island Troll Tribes.
It is written in JASS, vJass, and ZINC.
If you wish to work on the project you can fork it and issue pull requests.
At a nearby date I will make a downloadable version of your source available publically. (hopefully by Mar. '13)

___To build:___  

    $ ./compile # most basic way of calling compile
    # Its more interesting to view errors in a text editor, say vim:  
    $ ./compile > compiler_errors && vim compile_errors
